# RSC With Graph API

This sample illustrates how to grant consent through app manifest 

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 3.1

  ```bash
  # determine dotnet version
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer)

- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## To try this sample

- Clone the repository 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VaraPrasad-MSFT/RSCWithGraphAPI.git
   ```

- If you are using Visual Studio

  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
  - Navigate to `RSCWithGraphAPI` folder
  - Select `RSCWithGraphAPI.csproj` file
  - Press `F5` to run the project

- Run ngrok - point to port 3978
  ```bash
  ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
  ```

- Configure group owner consent settings in the Azure AD portal
  - Sign in to the Azure portal as a Global Administrator/Company Administrator.
  - Allow group owner consent for all group owners. For a team owner to install an app using RSC, group owner consent must be enabled for that user.

- Register your app with Microsoft identity platform via the Azure AD portal
  - Your app must be registered in the Azure AD portal to integrate with the Microsoft identity platform and call Microsoft Graph APIs. See [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2). 
  - Add your client id, client secret,tenant id and team id  in appsettings.json

- Update the ngrok in manifest along with the client id, client secret and team id and upload.

## Also
 - Once the app has been installed to a team, you can use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) to view the permissions that have been granted to the app in a team:

   - Get the team's groupId from the Teams client.
   - In the Teams client, select Teams from the far left nav bar.
   - Select the team where the app is installed from the drop-down menu.
   - Select the More options icon (⋯).
   - Select Get link to team.
   - Copy and save the groupId value from the string.
   - Log into Graph Explorer.
   - Make a GET call to the following endpoint: https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{teamGroupId}/permissionGrants. The clientAppId field in the response will map to the           appId specified in the Teams app manifest.
